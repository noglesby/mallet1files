Files and readme for workshop
Welcome to the Topic Modelling - Mallet Workshop 
In order to get started please move the Mallet ... directory from ... to the Desktop.
Next, download the found data set that we will be using for the workshop from this page (link at bottom), drag and drop into the Mallet directory on the Desktop and unzip directly into it.
As we have seen, Mallet is a commandline tool that requires the use of a terminal emulator. For the purposes of this workshop we will be using Jupyter notebooks because it allows us to easily save our work into a file that we can reference back to and because it's cooler than the built in commandline tools available natively on the big operating systems.
Jupyter Notebooks is already installed on the computers, so in order to access it simply open the Terminal application on your computer by selecting the Finder (this will open your a dialog box), select Applications from the right hand menu, scrolling down until you reach the Utilities folder, within this folder you'll find the Terminal application.
Once you have opened the Terminal application all you need to type is 'jupyter notebook'.
